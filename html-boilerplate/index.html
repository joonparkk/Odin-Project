    <h1> Welcome to Parkk Projects</h1>
    <p> 
        Hi! My name is Ryan Park, a UCI alumni and most importantly a programmer. 
        Having started my programming journey in the latter half of my college career, I came into it, a step behind my peers.
        I've always struggled with my identity, denying myself the title of programmer due to my lack of confidence.
        This webpage is my step forward to a better me, displaying my coding and personal accomplishments for everyone to see.
        Though it may not flamboyant or highly robust, I want to take pride in what i've completed and will be completing throughout the foreseeable future.
        Follow my story as I navigate through the digital and the physical as an ever learning human.
    </p>
